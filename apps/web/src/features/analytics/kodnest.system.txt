  KodNest Premium Build System — Design System Foundations

  PURPOSE:
  Establish a refined, premium SaaS design system for KodNest.

  DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
    - Calm, Intentional, Coherent, Confident
    - Restraint over flash: No gradients, no glass, no neons, no animation noise
    - Consistency and clarity in every visual and interaction decision

  COLOR PALETTE (Max 4 colors):
    • Background: #F7F6F3 (Off-white)
    • Primary Text: #111111
    • Accent (Primary Action): #8B0000 (Deep red)
    • Support (Success/Warning): Muted green, Muted amber
    — Palette remains minimal and balanced

  TYPOGRAPHY:
    - Headings: Large serif, confident, distinct spacing
    - Body: Sans-serif, 16–18px, generous line height (1.6–1.8), max 720px width
    - Strict size and family enforcement

  SPACING SYSTEM:
    - Unified scale only: 8 / 16 / 24 / 40 / 64 px
    - Whitespace is essential, never arbitrary

  GLOBAL LAYOUT:
    [Top Bar] → [Context Header] → [Primary Workspace + Secondary Panel] → [Proof Footer]

    • Top Bar:
      - Left: "KodNest Premium Build System"
      - Center: Progress indicator (Step X / Y)
      - Right: Status badge (Not Started / In Progress / Shipped)
    • Context Header:
      - Large headline (serif) with supportive subtext
    • Primary Workspace (70%):
      - Main interaction. Spacious cards, predictable patterns, no clutter
    • Secondary Panel (30%):
      - Step guide, prompt box, calm actionable buttons
    • Proof Footer:
      - Checklist: □ UI Built □ Logic Working □ Test Passed □ Deployed
      - User input required for every proof

  COMPONENTS:
    - Primary Button: Solid deep red (#8B0000), unified radius, subtle hover
    - Secondary Button: Outlined, color accent
    - Inputs: Clean borders, clear focus, never heavy or shadowed
    - Cards: Gentle border, balanced padding, ZERO drop shadow

  INTERACTIONS:
    - All transitions: 150–200ms ease-in-out
    - Zero bounce, zero parallax, nothing noisy

  STATES:
    - Errors: Calm explanation + solution
    - Empty: Suggest next step, always inviting

  SYSTEM INTEGRITY:
    Every visual and behavioral decision is unified, deliberate, and devoid of visual drift. This is not a student project—this system sets the standard for a premium business-to-consumer product.
